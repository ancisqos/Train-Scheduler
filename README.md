# Train-Scheduler

## Overview

Train Scheduler is an application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The app retrieves and manipulates user data using Moment JS. It provides up-to-date information about different trains, specifically arrival times and how many minutes remain until the train's arrival to the station.
